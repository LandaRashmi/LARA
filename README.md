# 🧠 AI-Powered Legal Research Assistant

## 📜 Overview
Legal professionals face the challenge of navigating an extensive and fragmented body of laws, case decisions, and constitutional provisions, making research both essential and arduous. Traditional legal research systems predominantly rely on keyword-based searches that often fail to capture the contextual nuances of queries, resulting in irrelevant or incomplete results.

This project aims to develop an **AI-powered Legal Research Assistant** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **advanced search algorithms** to improve search accuracy and speed. The system integrates case laws, statutes, and legal glossaries into a unified platform, enabling users—including lawyers, scholars, and the public—to quickly access pertinent legal information. By employing machine learning techniques and real-time updates on legal developments, the tool provides context-aware search results and summaries, enhancing productivity and informed decision-making.
